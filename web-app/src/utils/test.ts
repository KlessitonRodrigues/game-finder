    "<p><em>Baldur's Gate III</em> is a role-playing game situated within the established universe of the Forgotten Realms. The story unfolds around a group of characters who become infected by a parasitic tadpole, threatening to turn them into Mind Flayers, a dreaded and alien species known for their psionic abilities and power over other creatures. This central conflict serves as a catalyst, drawing the characters into a grander plot that spans diverse regions and encounters with various factions.</p>\n<p>Players can either choose the pre-designed Origin characters or craft their own from a selection of races and classes typical of Dungeons &amp; Dragons lore, such as elves, dwarves, wizards, and rogues, among others. The gameplay emphasizes turn-based tactical combat, where players must strategically deploy their party members on the battlefield, leveraging their unique abilities and spells. Additionally, decision-making and character interactions play significant roles, with player choices leading to varying narrative outcomes, affecting not only the story's progression but also relationships with party members and other NPCs.</p>\n<p>A notable feature is its adherence to many Dungeons &amp; Dragons mechanics, translating the tabletop experience into a digital format. Dice-rolling, a staple of the D&amp;D system, is integral to many actions and decisions in the game, introducing elements of chance and unpredictability. Environments in the game are highly interactive, allowing players to exploit them for strategic benefits during encounters. Furthermore, the game provides the option for cooperative play, letting multiple players navigate the narrative and challenges together.</p>",
